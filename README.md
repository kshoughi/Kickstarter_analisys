## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
In order to do analysis on this project, Excel was used to extract data. Then, pivot tables and other functions in Excel were used to create tables. Next, graphs were created to visulaize the trend.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- It can be seen that the Theatre campaigns are more successful when launched in month of May with 111 successful campaings followed by month of June with 100 successful campaign.

- Surprisingly, May have roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched followed by July, October and June. Therefore, it can be concluded that Theatre campaigns that have launched in month of May have both high number of success and failure.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It can be seen that the play campaigns are more successful when the goal is not much. As the goal increases, the percentage of successful campaigns decrease and the percentage of failed campaigns increase. However, from 25000-2999 to 40000-44999 goal, the percentage of successful play campaigns increase, and percentage of failed campaigns decrease. Then, from 45000 onwards, the trend reverses with increased failed campaigns.
## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For this assignment, no major difficulties or challenges were encountered. However, One possible challenge in this dataset is that the time stamps were difficult to read and a conversion is needed. However, this can be easily solved by converting the time stampes to dates by dividing the time stamps by (60x60x24) and adding date 1970-01-01
## Results
Based on the graphs, it can be concluded that that in order to launch a successful Play campaign, it is advised to launch the campaign in month of May. It is also advised to have a low goal. This way the chance of success increases.
## Data Limitations
- One of the limitations is that the data had outliers that could potentially screw the results.
- Also if the study is performed on more years, then the data could be more reliable.
